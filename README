DMX Shield Project Summary:

This repository is an open hardware add-on for the maple native platform.
It incorporates three hardware features into a single shield: first, the DMX
physical layer protocol operates on RS-485 differential signaling; second,
audio is played through an audio codec chip; and third, a source of recorded media is made available through an SD card slot.

A demonstration sketch for the DMX protocol is available here:

with other examples to be committed later
